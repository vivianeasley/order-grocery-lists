# Super Basic List Orderer For Local Grocery Stores

During the pandemic my wife and I were regularly ordering our shopping lists to minimize the amount of time we spent in grocery stores. I wrote this very simple program that takes our shopping lists, fuzzy matches items, and auto orders them based on the layout of our local grovery stores. This is likely useless to everyone except us. Written in a couple hours so not qaulity code.
